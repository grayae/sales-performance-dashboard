# Sales Performance Dashboard  
A Power BI Sales Performance Dashboard using SQL and public sales data. 

## Overview  
This project analyzes sales data from the Kaggle Superstore Sales Dataset using SQL for data preparation and Power BI + DAX for calculations and visualizations. It includes key business insights such as revenue trends, top-selling products, geographic performance and customer analysis.  

## Skills Demonstrated  
- SQL: Data cleaning, handling missing values, date formatting and transformations.  
- Power BI & DAX: KPI calculations, visualizations and interactive dashboard design.  

## Tools Used  
- SQL: Data extraction and preparation  
- Power BI:  Dashboard and KPI calculations  
- DAX: Custom calculations & aggregations  
- CSV Dataset: Public dataset from Kaggle  

## Process Summary  
### Data Preparation (SQL)  
- Explored and cleaned raw sales data.  
- Standardized column names and handled missing values.  
- Removed duplicates and fixed date fields to the correct type.  
- Exported the cleaned dataset to Power BI.  

### Dashboard Creation (Power BI)
